    <h1>My Favorite Songs</h1>
        <p>Music is one of the most enjoyable things in my life. Pop music will always be my favorite, though I enjoy some genres of rock and occasionally country music. I especially enjoy listening to music on the car, more so when we are going on a long road trip. After listening to coutless hours of music, I'd like to share my favorites.</p>
    <h2>#1: "I Knew You Were Trouble" by Taylor Swift</h2>
        <p>T-Swizzle is my favorite musician (cool nickname). "I Knew You Were Trouble" is in Taylor's album <i>Red</i>, which seems to be the fan-favorite album. Taylor states that this song describes a toxic relationship between two people, where both of them know that the relationship probably won't last. The music video ends up showing Taylor's boyfriend kissing another woman at the end. This song has electronic beats and I think I would classify it as alternative rock. The verses build up for a really epic and grand chorus, and the pacing is amazing.</p>

    <h2>#2: "Boyfriend" by Ashlee Simpson</h2>
        <p>Ashlee Simpson is my other favorite musician. She seems really relatable and her music is very catchy. "Boyfriend" is not her most famous song, but it is my favorite. This song is rumored to be about Ashlee's alleged affair with Wilmar Valderamma, who was Lindsay Lohan's ex. Ashlee denies that she stole Lindsay's boyfriend in her song. In an interview with Andy Cohen many years later, Ashlee confirmed the rumors but stated that Wilmer and her never dated. "Boyfriend" definitely tends to lean towards more pop than rock. Ashlee's considered a pop singer but her music really leans more towards rock.</p>

    <h2>#3: "Pieces of Me" by Ashlee Simpson</h2>
        <p>Yeah, I really do love Ashlee Simpson's music. This is her foremost song and one of her earliest, too. "Pieces of Me" is part of Ashlee Simpson's successful first album, <i>Autobiography</i>, which sold five million copies worldwide. This song is a cross between pop and rock, though it isn't as loud and chaotic as typical rock songs. The notes in "Pieces of Me" are extended, so it gives off a feeling of weightlesness, like you're floating. This is a delightfully charming song.</b2>

    <h2>#4: "Autobiography" by Ashlee Simpson</h2>
        <p>"Autobiography" utilizes the guitar and drum to create a really catchy rhythm. Ashlee Simpson talks about herself in this song in a quite genuine manner. She says she's "got stains on my TV" and that "sometimes I get dark." She then proceeds to tell the audience that, if they want her autobiography, they just have to ask her. This song definitely leans toward punk and hard rock, especially the middle section. It's dark, loud, and most importantly, pleasant to listen to.</p>

    <h2>#5: "Love Me for Me" by Ashlee Simpson</h2>
        <p>This song is quite similar to "Autobiography." The title basically gives the content of this song away. Ashlee does something that I find really interesting in this song, though. She contradicts herself: "Shut up, come back... I love you, I hate you." The ending of LMFM is kind of epic and sounds like an old, classical rock song. It gives off that floating feeling I mentioned for "Pieces of Me." Ashlee's music is quite similar yet different (I contradicted myself too).</p>

    <h2>#6: "22" by Taylor Swift</h2>
        <p>"22" can easily be placed in Taylor Swift's <i>Red</i> album. The beats are just so similar to the other songs in the album. "22" seems like the perfect party song. It's upbeat, chaotic, and loud. I instantly fall into a better mood whenever I listen to this song. Taylor talks about being 22 and perfectly captures the spirit of being a teenager or young adult. "22" gives off that pure "feel good" vibe similar to "Shake It Off."</p>

    <h2>#7: "Love Story" by Taylor Swift</h2>
        <p>Oh, this song. "Love Story" is probably the most romantic song I have ever heard. The lyrics are genius, too. Taylor makes use of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> to tell an epic love story. I really like the vocals in this song. They sound more youthful and innocent than the rerecorded version, though both are great. The vocals perfectly fit with this song and its rhythm. The greatest part of this song is during the last chorus, when Taylor tells that her love pulled out a ring and they got married! It's really romantic.</p>

    <h2>#8: "L.O.V.E." by Ashlee Simpson</h2>
        <p>This is one of Ashlee Simpson's more famous songs, though it never became as famous as it could have been. It seems that, after the SNL Incident and the Orange Bowl Performance, people just weren't willing to give Ashlee Simpson another chance. However, this song was quite popular at parties, at least from what I've heard. It does give off that party vibe. Gwen taught us how to spell b-a-n-a-n-a and Ashlee taught us l-o-v-e.</p>

    <h2>#9: "Delicate" by Taylor Swift</h2>
        <p>"Delicate", like "22", makes it easy to guess which album it's from. It's very chill and relaxed and I guess you could say leans a bit more towards hip-hop than most of Taylor's other songs. This song talks about, you guessed it, Taylor's delicate relationship with her boyfriend. She likes and wants him, but she knows that their relationship is fragile at the moment. The verses "My reputation's never been worse, so you must like me for me" seemed really weird to me. Did Taylor every think that her boyfriend liked her because of her money or reputation? Saying that would probably hurt her already-fragile relationship.</p>

    <h2>#10: "Move Along" by All-American Rejects</h2>
        <p>Lately, I've really gotten into the All-American Rejects. They make really good alternative music with their electric guitars. This song constantly repeats a few notes on the electric guitar, and somehow they manage to pull it off and make it extremely catchy. It's also nice that this song tells us to "Move Along". When something doesn't go our way, we should have faith and hope for better things. I guess part of the reason I really like this song is because it's relatable.</p>

    <h2>#11: "Cool" by Gwen Stefani</h2>
        <p>This used to be my favorite favorite song. If I were to have chosen a song to listen to forever back then, it would be this. Now, I think I've overlistened to this song. It's still really catchy but I'm just not excited to listen to it anymore. The notes in this song seem to jump around quite a bit, though I am certainly no expert in the musical field. "Cool" talks about Gwen Stefani's friendship with her ex, Tony Kanal, even after all the hardships they went through. She's happy that he's moved on, and now she also has found true love. This song demonstrates how mature and sincere Gwen is. She isn't sad or angry at her ex, but has moved on and manages to still keep a healthy relationship with him.</p>

    <h2>#12: "Blank Space" by Taylor Swift</h2>
        <p>The "Blank Space" music video has received over 2.8 billion views on YouTube. That alone tells us how popular this song is. Of course, the high amount of views are also because the music video was directed by Joseph Kahn. The style of the song perfectly matches the music video. It sounds forlorn and unlike any of Taylor's other songs. The video is set in a castle so the song reminds me of <i>Dracula</i>. "Blank Space" has a really slow, yet epic, chorus, and it gave us the famous lines "darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream." Go figure.</p>

    <h2>#13: "You Belong With Me" by Taylor Swift</h2>
        <p>Though "Love Story" is considered the quintessential song of Taylor's country era, this song comes at a close second. I'd definitely say it leans toward rock as well. For some reason this song reminds me of Knoxville, Tennessee. It's a country song and I saw a video about college football in Knoxville so maybe that's why. I think Taylor's vocals match perfectly with this song. When she was younger and had a more nasally voice, she was better-suited for country. When she got older and her voice matured, it became better for pop. Taylor's transition was a smart move in my opinion.</p>

    <h2>#14: "Stacy's Mom" by Fountains of Wayne</h2>
        <p>This is a song I listened to during the summer of 2020. This song is very upbeat and optimistic and reminds me of a sunny summer day enjoyed at the park or pool. It definitely gives off that summer vibe. "Stacy's Mom" references the 1982 movie <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>, which has Stacy for the main character's name. This song is about a teenager's crush on his friend Stacy's mom. Stacy also happens to have a crush on her teenager friend, leading to a very convoluted story. However, the song approaches this in a lighthearted and funny way. It's delightful.</p>

    <h2>#15: "Lucky" by Britney Spears</h2>
    <p>This was my first favorite song. It's calm, dainty, and reminds me of a peaceful night at home. I listened to this song on repeat during quarantine, when Britney was one of my favorite singers, and, after all this time, it still hasn't gotten boring. I guess that's part of the charm. "Lucky" is basically Britney predicting her meltdown in 2000, talking about how lonely she is and the "tears [that] come at night." The story's sad, but the song is charming.</p>
