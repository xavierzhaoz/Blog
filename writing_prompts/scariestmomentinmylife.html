    <h1>The Scariest Moment in My Life</h1>
        <p>Forty feet off the ground, my brain was swarmed with a thousand thoughts a second and I lost all sense of time. I desperately held on to the crevice as my fingers slowly slipped down, one by one. I faced a drop below that would, if I were lucky, leave me with broken limbs and, if I were unlucky, leave me dead or paralyzed. Bringing myself into this situation was as confounding as it was risky. Would the drop be painful? What would my life be like if I slipped? I berated myself on my daringness and audacity. If only I had taken the easier path. Everything seemed fine while I was walking up the mountain. But with each passing step, the path grew narrower and the drop greater. Still, if I didn’t make any silly mistakes, I thought I would be fine. That was until I saw the rock blocking the path ahead of me. It struck right through the middle, and there were two risky options I could take to cross it. I glanced down, and there were nothing but huge, jagged boulders waiting to be smeared with the blood of anyone unfortunate enough to fall. There were two options to pass the boulder. Either I go above it, which would give me no chance to grab onto anything as I fell head-first onto the craggy rocks below, or I go below the rock, which meant the boulder wouldn’t be behind me to stop my fall, but which would give me a chance to grab onto something. I chose the bottom route, maybe because I didn’t get much sleep that night and my thinking skills were impaired. I was halfway-done crossing the boulder until suddenly, the pebbles below me fell. I slipped and, as if by a miracle, I grabbed onto a small crevice on the path. The only thing between the rocks and me were two fingers that miraculously held nearly 200-pounds. I looked around, too dazed to realize what was happening. In the background, I could hear myself calling my dad to pull me up. I was so surprised, confused, scared, and happy when I got pulled off that I laughed it off. It’s funny how the scariest moment of your life can become one of the happiest just seconds later.</p>
