    <h1>My Favorite Songs</h1>
        <p>Music is one of the most enjoyable things in my life. Well, I enjoy certain types. Pop music will always be my favorite, though I enjoy some genres of rock and occasionally country music. I especially enjoy listening to music on the car, more so when we are going on a long road trip. After listening to coutless hours of music, I'd like to share my favorites.</p>
    <h2>#1: "Boyfriend" by Ashlee Simpson</h2>
        <p>Ashlee Simpson is my favorite musician.</p>

    <h2>#3: "Pieces of Me" by Ashlee Simpson</h2>
        <p>Yeah, I really do love Ashlee Simpson's music. This is her foremost song and one of her earliest, too. "Pieces of Me" is part of Ashlee Simpson's successful first album, Autobiography, which sold five million copies worldwide. This song is a cross between pop and rock, though it isn't as loud and chaotic as typical rock songs. The notes in "Pieces of Me" are extended, so it gives off a feeling of weightlesness, like you're floating. Overall, this is a delightfully charming song.</b2>

    <h2>#8: "L.O.V.E." by Ashlee Simpson</h2>
    <p>This is one of Ashlee Simpson's more famous songs, though it never became as famous as it was supposed to be. It seems that, after the SNL Incident and the Orange Bowl Performance, people just weren't willing to give Ashlee Simpson another chance. However, this song was played quite a lot at parties when it came out. It does give off that party vibe. This was back during the period when musicians taught us to spell. Gwen taught us b-a-n-a-n-a and Ashlee taught us l-o-v-e.</p>

    <h2>#9: "Cool" by Gwen Stefani</h2>
    <p>This used to be my favorite favorite song. If I were to have chosen a song to listen to forever back then, it would be this. Now, I think I've overlistened to this song. The notes in this song seem to jump around quite a bit, though I am certainly no expert in the musical field. "Cool" talks about Gwen Stefani's friendship with her ex, Tony Kanal, even after all the hardships they went through. She's happy that he's moved on, and now she also has found true love. This song demonstrates how mature and sincere Gwen is. She isn't sad or angry at her ex, but has moved on and manages to still keep a healthy relationship with him.</p>

    <h2>#11: "You Belong With Me" by Taylor Swift</h2>
        <center><img src="https://static.billboard.com/files/media/taylor-swift-you-belong-with-me-tbt-billboard-650-compressed.jpg"></center>
    <h2>#12: "Lucky" by Britney Spears</h2>
    <p>This is my first favorite song. It's calm, dainty, and reminds me of a peaceful night at home. I listened to this song on repeat during quarantine, when Britney was one of my favorite singers, and, after all this time, it still hasn't gotten boring. I guess that's part of the charm. "Lucky" is basically Britney predicting her meltdown in 2000, talking about how lonely she is and the "tears [that] come at night." The story's sad, but the song is charming.</p>

    <h2>#13: "Stacy's Mom" by Fountains of Wayne</h2>
    <p>This is another song I listened to during the summer of 2020. It's quite the opposite of "Say It Right," being very upbeat and optimistic and remindind me of a sunny summer day enjoyed at the park or pool. "Stacy's Mom" references the 1982 movie <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>, which has Stacy for the main character's name. This song is about a teenager's crush on his friend Stacy's mom. Stacy also happens to have a crush on her teenager friend, leading to a very convoluted story. However, the song approaches this in a lighthearted and funny way. It's delightful.</p>

    <h2>#14: "Come Clean" by Hilary Duff</h2>
        <center><img src="https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/965739100_1280x720.jpg"></center>
    <h2>#15: "Say It Right" by Nelly Furtado and Timbaland</h2>
        <p>This song reminds me of the summer of 2020. It was my most-played and favorite song back then, but I got tired of it after a while. "Say It Right" has the heavy beats typical of Timbaland and his distinctive "eh". The song is accompanied by the singing expertise of Nelly Furtado, who was my favorite singer during the 2020 summer because of this song. This song evokes memories of somewhere forlorn and far away, maybe a forest in China. "Say It Right" gives off that afternoon feeling of nostalgia, sadness, and longing.</p>
